The accompanying solution contains both code and unit tests for the 3 problems from the Quadrus Developer Practicum. Code and tests were written in C# using visual studio.
The first problem, in addition to tests, can be verified by running the QuadrusDeveloperPracticum.exe created by compiling the code.
Both solutions for problems 2 and 3 can be verified by running the accompanying unit test solution.
An assumption was made that the tree structure did not need to be balanced and so node creation and movement favours the left side of the tree.
